## Features

In our latest project, NEST/MUSIC, we set out to reimagine the music streaming experience by combining the best features of Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music with our own unique enhancements. Here's an overview of the exciting features we've implemented:

1. **Persistent Playback**: Enjoy uninterrupted music playback while navigating the site, with playback persisting until manually stopped. Details of the song playing are also displayed for easy reference.
2. **Real-time Volume Control**: Users have the flexibility to adjust the volume for a personalized listening experience, ensuring optimal enjoyment of their favorite tracks.
3. **Playbar Indicator**: The playbar indicator of the song while playing is not functioning as intended and is planned for improvement in future iterations.
4. **Genre-Based Exploration**: Explore music by genre, discovering new artists and tracks based on your musical preferences.
5. **Comprehensive Content Pages**: Dive into dedicated pages for albums, songs, and artists, facilitating easy exploration of related content for enhanced music discovery.
6. **Liked Songs Library**: The Liked Songs Library feature enables users to effortlessly add songs to their "Liked Songs" collection. Real-time updates ensure easy access to their favorite tracks, and users also have the ability to remove songs from the Liked Songs library. Any changes made to the library are reflected instantly, providing a seamless and dynamic music browsing experience.
7. **Custom Playlist Creation**: NEST/MUSIC lets users curate their music with custom My playlist. Removing song from the playlist is instantly reflected across the platform for a seamless experience.
8. **Creation of Unique Playlists**: NEST/MUSIC curated three unique playlists, carefully selecting music for each to provide users with easy listening options.

For future development, it's important to note the following restrictions:

1. **Updating Liked Songs and My Playlist Libraries**: Both the Liked Songs and My Playlist libraries show liked and added songs, respectively, but they don't update the page in real time when the user clicks any of the two buttons available in the song card. The user needs to refresh the page to see the updated listing under the two library pages.
2. **Forward and Rewind Buttons**: The forward and rewind buttons are currently non-functional and will be addressed in future updates.

During the Winter Semester, the proponents incorporated insights gathered from their studies, along with information sourced from the internet. This included utilizing Figma from the UI/UX Design course, which played a crucial role in organizing the project's flow. Furthermore, they employed React, as well as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS coding to implement various features. Additionally, the team devised a comprehensive database containing a wide array of images and tracks, meticulously curated to test the project's functionality thoroughly.

Finally, the proponents would like to acknowledge some sources such as Font Awesome, FlatIcon, Pixabay (audio), Unsplash (photos), Squoosh, and ChatGPT (text contents and suggestions).

Thank you.
